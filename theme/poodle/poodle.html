        <p>Contrary to what some could think at first, <em>Poodles</em> are not born with such elaborate hairstyles
         as we often see on television, but are cut to the owner's content and imagination as they are gifted with so much hair.
        Not only are they gifted with a lot of hair, but also with a lot of intelligence as they are ranked to be the second smartest
     breed of dogs.</p>

        <p>Poodles come in three categories <em>Standard Poddle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle.</em></p>
        <p>Poodles have a tendency to be very protective of their homes, and are very playful, carrying lots of energy
             especially as puppies still growing up.
